## Description

The goal of this application is to track specific workouts for a signed-up user with a performant backend and slick frontend by using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node (MERN).

### Mock Up

### Task Completed

I've built this application from scratch by utilizing a GraphQL API built with an Apollo Server. By building it with a MERN stack, it allows users to save their progress over time to the back end.

Essentially, I've set up the Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data. I've also implemented an authentication middleware so that it works in the GraphQL API context by creating an Apollo Provider to communicate with the Apollo Server.

This self-driven project should set myself up for future success by applying the core skills I've recently learned, primarily integrating various platforms into one, user-friendly application.
